This backend project task is designed for junior developer candidates to evaluate their skills in Django and Django REST Framework. The project is a simplified **Job Listing Platform (JobSite)** with user authentication, role-based access, job posting, and application tracking functionalities.

---

### ✅ Initial Setup (Already Done)
- User registration API
- Token authentication using JWT (SimpleJWT)
- Project initialized and uploaded to GitHub

---

### 🚀 Task Breakdown

#### 1. Role-Based User Model
- Add `role` field in `User` model.
- Allowed role choices:
  - `Recruiter`
  - `Candidate`
- Implement role based authorization for different type of roles, also for every endpoint use permission classes except public endpoint.

#### 2. Send Email on Registration
- After successful user registration, send a welcome email to user using `python-decouple`
- Email credentials must be stored securely in `.env`

#### 3. Forgot & Reset Password
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Forgot Password: sends reset link to user’s email
  - Reset Password: allows setting a new password using the reset token

---

### 📂 Job Application Module

#### 4. Job Posting
- Only `Recruiter` users can create, update, or delete jobs
- Job model fields may include:
  -Unique_Job_ID, Title, Description, Location, Salary, Deadline, Status, etc.

#### 5. Job Applications
- Only `Candidate` users can apply to jobs
- Prevent applications:
  - After job deadline
  - Multiple times to the same job by the same candidate

---

### 📊 Recruiter Dashboard Endpoint
Create an endpoint to return the following stats for the logged-in recruiter:

- Total published jobs
- Total closed jobs
- Total candidate applications
- Total candidates hired
- Total candidates rejected

---

### 📌 General Requirements

- Use **Django REST Framework (DRF)** with **class-based views**
- Use **custom permissions** to restrict actions by role
- Clean, paginated, RESTful APIs
- Admin panel must reflect all models
- Use **Swagger/OpenAPI** documentation (drf-yasg)

---

### 🛠️ Instructions for Candidates

1. Clone the GitHub repository provided
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Follow the existing structure and complete the tasks
4. Use `.env` for sensitive credentials (email, DB, secret keys)

---

### 🎯 Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization
- Proper use of Django & DRF features
- Clean and consistent API structure
- Secure and efficient implementation
- Git commit history and documentation

---

Please write clean, modular, and testable code. Document all your API endpoints properly. Ask questions if anything is unclear.

Good luck! 🚀
